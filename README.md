TB Prediction using X-Ray images (Deep Learning)

Description: The standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is created by the National Library of Medicine, Maryland, USA in collaboration with Shenzhen No.3 Peopleâ€™s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China. The Chest X-rays are from out-patient clinics, and were captured as part of the daily routine using Philips DR Digital Diagnose systems. Number of X-rays:

336 cases with manifestation of tuberculosis, and
326 normal cases. Image parameters:
Format: PNG
Image size varies for each X-ray. It is approximately 3K x 3K.
Problem Statement: Using Deep Learning detect Tuberculosis of a patient by analysing his X-Ray report.

Deep Learning problem
1. Using VGG-19, ResNet50 and Inception-V3 networks build models.
2. Use accuracy to compare performance of the three models.
3. Write a function to tune the threshold of the best model such that the AUC of the model is above x%(let default be 90%) and plot the confusion matrix with that tuned threshold.
